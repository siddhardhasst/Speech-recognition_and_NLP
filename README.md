# Speech Recognition
Implementation details could be found [here](/finalreport.pdf)
## Introduction
Speech recognition is invading our lives. It's built into our phones, our game consoles and our smart watches. It's even automating our homes. 
## Our Proposal
### Data generation and pre-processing: 
Generating dataset for numbers from 0 to 9 and pre-processing the data.
### Training and testing: 
We would use the generated dataset for classifying numbers from 0 to 9. 
### Extension: 
We would try to incorporate natural way of saying numbers like 109 will not only be 'one zero nine' but also 'one hundred nine'.

# Natural Language Processing

## Introduction
Natural Language processing is something which keeps artificial intelligence out of the race with Humans, but with artificial neural networks and powerful computing resources, Natural language processing is making life easier. 
## Our Proposal
### Overall idea: 
A chatbot that would reply to questions. The answers won't be hard-coded like they used to be previously, but be learnt by the bot.
### Data generation and pre-processing: 
It would be highly difficult to generate the huge amount of data that would be required to efficiently train a chatbot, so we would use already available data of dialogues of various movies and transform them to vectors. 
### Training and testing: 
The training part would be trivial. For testing, the way we are going to measure the accuracy has to be innovative. We haven't thought of it yet. One way is to manually test the chatbot, based on how reliable the response is and give a score manually. However this method is highly inefficient and unreliable. 
### Extension: 
This chatbot can be trained on customer service communication, this will make the chatbot a virtual assistant to those landing on your webpage.
